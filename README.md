> Algorithms implementation for Algorithms and Data Structures course 

Algorithms implementation which I made in 2019, during my second semester for Algorithms and Data Structures course

## List of algorithms
1. ✔️ Iterator <br/>
   - 🔸 Filter iterator (based on predicate) </br>
   - 🔸 Transform iterator (iterator which transform collection by multiply every element by given value) </br>
2. ✔️ ONP calculator <br/>
   - 🔸 ONP calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, roots, log) </br>
3. ✔️ Simple sort algorithms <br/>
   - 🔸 Bubble sort </br>
   - 🔸 Insert sort </br>
   - 🔸 Select sort </br>
   - 🔸 Shell sort (Shell sort distance, Sedgewick sort distance) </br>
4. ✔️ Complex sort algorithms <br/>
   - 🔸 Quick sort </br>
   - 🔸 Merge sort </br>
   - 🔸 Heap sort </br>
5. ✔️ Dijkstra's algorithm (Shortest Path First (SPF) -  Finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph) <br/>
6. ✔️ Kruskal's algorithm (Finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a connected weighted graph ) <br/>
